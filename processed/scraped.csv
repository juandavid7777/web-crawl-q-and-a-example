We employ state-of-the-art AI and machine learning to keep a vigilant eye on every cycle market indicator. Free sign-up Login      Your journey into the Bitcoin cycles starts here  Cover the Whole Market in one Place: Say goodbye to time wasted navigating countless websites and searching for fragmented information.  Cycle Trend Assessment: Our AI-driven analysis deciphers market indicators and learns from past cycles, enabling us to pinpoint trend shifts, cycle bottoms, and peaks.  Stay Informed and Balanced: We bring you balanced Artificial Intelligence strategies along the Bitcoin cycles, so you can make data-informed decisions with confidence.  Artificial Intelligence Edge: Harnessing the power of cutting-edge machine learning, we synthesize data from 10+ leading indicators to provide crystal-clear insights into Bitcoin cycles.  Comprehensive Analysis: Our approach combines on-chain data, sentiment analysis, and technical expertise to give you a holistic understanding of Bitcoin's intricate dynamics.  Free sign-up      How it works The Role of Bitcoin Halving A pivotal concept in our methodology is Bitcoin halving. This event marks a fundamental change in the Bitcoin ecosystem, where the rate at which new bitcoins are created is halved approximately every four years. This event triggers a cascade of effects on the market, and it's a key component of our analysis. The next Bitcoin halving is expected on 206.0 more days (2024-04-22). Can you spot the repeating patterns within other previous cycles? After every halving, the reduction in supply triggers a parabollic uptrend bull run. Such price change cannot be sustained indefinitely and soon after the bear market begins with large drawdowns and reaching a new cycle bottom. Finally, there is a sideways market that consolidates the price before the next havling which triggers a new cycle. Nine Comprehensive Metrics Technical Indicators We delve into technical aspects of Bitcoin, considering historical price data, trading volumes, and chart patterns. These technical indicators provide us with valuable insights into market behavior. On-Chain Data By scrutinizing on-chain data, we track the movement of bitcoins across the blockchain. This data reveals critical information about market sentiment, investor behavior, and network health. Sentiment Analysis Understanding market sentiment is crucial. We leverage sentiment analysis tools to gauge the collective mood of Bitcoin traders and investors, helping us anticipate market shifts. Machine Learning in Action Our approach is rooted in data-driven Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By integrating information from diverse sources, we create a dynamic model capable of identifying repeating patterns within each Bitcoin halving cycle. Data Collection We collect an extensive dataset covering historical Bitcoin price movements, on-chain data, and sentiment indicators. This data forms the foundation of our analysis. Feature Engineering Our team of data scientists carefully engineers features from the collected data to create meaningful input variables for our ML model. Model Training Understanding market sentiment is crucial. We leverage sentiment analysis tools to gauge the collective mood of Bitcoin traders and investors, helping us anticipate market shifts.We train our ML model using state-of-the-art algorithms. The model learns from historical data, discovering intricate patterns and relationships. Pattern Recognition Our model excels at recognizing patterns in Bitcoin price behavior, investor sentiment, and network activity. It adapts as new data becomes available, ensuring its accuracy and relevance. Mapping Bitcoin's Trend Through our data-driven approach, we aim to map the market's trend within each Bitcoin halving cycle. By doing so, we provide you with valuable insights to make informed decisions in this dynamic and ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Stay Tuned and Keep Accumulating! Bitcoin's journey is marked by its fascinating cycles, and our commitment is to keep you informed every step of the way.

Unlocking the Potential of Bitcoin Cycles: A Data Science and Machine Learning Approach Bitcoin halving's effect on price Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has experienced notable price cycles since its inception. These cycles often exhibit patterns influenced by various factors. One approach to understand and predict these cycles is by utilizing the concept of Bitcoin halving which defines a repetitive fundamental change which results in a reiteration of certain market dynamics. Building on this idea, a comprehensive analysis of nine metrics has been conducted, encompassing technical, on-chain, and sentiment indicators. By incorporating information from multiple sources, we implement a data-driven Machine Learning methodology to identify repeating patterns and map the market’s trend within each Bitcoin's halving cycle.

Future work will add new metrics that follow an oscillating cyclic pattern that relates to the Bitcoin repeating dynamics. Common cyclic peaks (red), valleys (green) and mid-cycle (yellow & orange) areas can be identified in individual metrics, however, a confluence approach should be implemented to reduce the risk when classifying the market trend.

Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

The hyperplane tries that the margin between the closest points of different classes should be as maximum as possible. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is two, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is three, then the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds three [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/].

It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data). Intuitively, given any indicators we can identify some clusters or groups with similar values across their indicator values. Now, given an unclassified point, we can assign it to a group by observing what group its nearest neighbors belong to. This means a point close to a cluster of points classified as ‘bullish’ has a higher probability of getting classified as ‘bullish’ [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/].

The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem that finds the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive [https://towardsdatascience.com/naive-bayes-classifier-81d512f50a7c].             Colored                Footer of indicators text       "

It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables and the dependent binary variables. It is a powerful tool for decision-making.  It’s referred to as regression because it takes the output of the linear regression function as input and uses a sigmoid function to estimate the probability for the given class. The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-logistic-regression/?ref=lbp].

High values are observed near the peaks, while low values occur close to the bottom of the cycle. However, assessing the overall risk based on a single metric is challenging. To address this, we employ a linear combination that averages all the metrics, creating a single value known as the “confluence risk.” To compute the confluence risk, we normalize each metric and then calculate the mean value across all the metrics, producing a composite risk indicator. Notably, bottoms tend to have confluence risk values below 0.25, while peaks typically exceed 0.75.                Colored                     Grouped                Footer of indicators text       "
