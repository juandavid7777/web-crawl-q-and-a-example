            K-NN
          

             K-Nearest Neighbours is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning typically applied for pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection.

It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data). Intuitively, given any indicators we can identify  some clusters or groups with similar values across their indicator values. Now, given an unclassified point, we can assign it to a group by observing what group its nearest neighbors belong to. This means a point close to a cluster of points classified as ‘bullish’ has a higher probability of getting classified as ‘bullish’ [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/].
