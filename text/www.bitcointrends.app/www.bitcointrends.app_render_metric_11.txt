            Random Forest
          

             Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction [https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2].
