            Confluence risk
          

             Bitcoin cycle selected metrics exhibit an oscillation pattern that closely aligns with the 4 year cycle. High values are observed near the peaks, while low values occur close to the bottom of the cycle. However, assessing the overall risk based on a single metric is challenging. To address this, we employ a linear combination that averages all the metrics, creating a single value known as the “confluence risk.”

To compute the confluence risk, we normalize each metric and then calculate the mean value across all the metrics, producing a composite risk indicator. Notably, bottoms tend to have confluence risk values below 0.25, while peaks typically exceed 0.75.
