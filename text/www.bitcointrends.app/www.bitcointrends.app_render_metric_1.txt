            Time channel
          

             Utilizes a logarithmic growth curve estimation of Bitcoin to estimate the historic growth trend of Bitcoin with time. This curve can be taken as the general trend line of Bitcoin throughout its history. Furthermore, the normalized deviation of the price from this curve can be taken as an oscillator similar to the Bitcoin Rainbow Price Chart Indicator whose idea dates back to a Bitcoin forum in 2014.
