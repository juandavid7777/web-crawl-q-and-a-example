            Logistic Regression
          

             Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class or not. It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables and the dependent binary variables. It is a powerful tool for decision-making. 

Itâ€™s referred to as regression because it takes the output of the linear regression function as input and uses a sigmoid function to estimate the probability for the given class. The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-logistic-regression/?ref=lbp].
