            Support Vector Machine
          

             Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm whose main objective is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in the feature space. The hyperplane tries that the margin between the closest points of different classes should be as maximum as possible. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is two, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is three, then the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds three [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/].
