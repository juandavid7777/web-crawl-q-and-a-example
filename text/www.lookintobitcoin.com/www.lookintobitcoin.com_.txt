The only place where I get a clear holistic view of Bitcoin. Other platforms provide piecemeal sections of information such as derivatives data or on-chain data but Look Into Bitcoin is the most comprehensive analytics platform available where I see everything easily in one place with stunning charts.

Look Into Bitcoin is my go-to for Bitcoin information. Bitcoin leads the crypto market, so if you know what's happening with it, you know where the rest of the market is going. There is now no better analytics than Look Into Bitcoin.

Look Into Bitcoin is FIRE! I can't believe it took me this long to finally subscribe but there is so much value in it. Yes, there are a ton of onchain charts but it goes beyond just the 'here's onchain data' internal stuff and dives deep into the key global macro charts, long-term investment planning, alerts for all the key charts, and how to understand where Bitcoin price is going next. 'Totally worth it!' would be an understatement.
