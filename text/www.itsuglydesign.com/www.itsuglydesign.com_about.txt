04About Ugly. Brand and Product Design. Minimalism, symmetry, balance and beauty are Japanese aesthetic principles to change your thinking. Each design is based on these rules to maintain balance and harmony which can be described as sameness, the belonging of one thing with another. 
 
As an example Kanji are the adopted logographic Chinese characters that are used in the Japanese writing system. They are used alongside the Japanese syllabic scripts hiragana and katakana. Kanji are used for writing nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs. But unlike the Chinese language, Japanese cannot be written entirely in kanji. There fore it has something else to give it sense.
​
Ma (間) is a Japanese word which can be roughly translated as "gap", "space", "pause" or "the space between two structural parts." The spatial concept is experienced progressively through intervals of spatial designation. ... Therefore, ma can be defined as experiential place understood with emphasis on interval.
​
​
Ma, is the emptiness full of possibilities, like a promise yet to be fulfilled.
 
This is the essence of Ugly design, from the first stroke or idea, even though it's not beautiful, still is the beginning. From ugliness beauty arises. Whether there is or not, everything is possible. 
​
Welcome to the Ugly Design, cause the bad, the nasty and the ugly, are the essence of design. The first ugly sketch will be the spirit of the result. Nothing is pleasing at first sight, there's a story behind.

We were all ugly

“A lot of nice things are ugly and a lot of nasty things are beautiful. Ugliness is relative to the point of view.” .
